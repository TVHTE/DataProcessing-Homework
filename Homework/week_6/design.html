        <h2> Map </h2><br/>
            <p>
                <strong>The colour:</strong><br/>
                    The map is filled with different colours. This is done to show more contrast between
                    the different provinces.<br/><br/>
                <strong>The hover:</strong><br/>
                    Switches the colour from the original colour of the provinces to red,
                    this is done in order to give a more clear overview to the user.<br/><br/>
                <strong>The click:</strong><br/>
                    When clicked on the map the line graph changes. At first the line graph changed when hovering over the Netherlands with the mouse.<br/>
                    However, this made it impossible to clearly view the temperature for the provinces in the middle of the map,
                    because it is hard to keep your mouse exactly on the same spot.<br/>

            </p>
        <h2> Line Graph </h2>
            <p>
                The line graph shows the max temperature for a whole year. When clicking on the
                different provinces, the line graph is updated.
